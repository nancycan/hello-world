This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow
I am brand new to this and I'm a little overwhelmed, but excited to be trying something new. I'm going back to school for electrical engineering and right off the bat I'm excited to be learning some beginning level C++. I would love to keep learning even after my class ends so that I can improve my skills over time.
